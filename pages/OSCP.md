# OSCP Journey
I decided to start my journey towards the [Offensive Security Certified Practitioner](https://www.offensive-security.com/pwk-oscp/) certification and will begin on 1 February 2020. I will be leading a [study group](https://womenscyberjutsu.org/events/EventDetails.aspx?id=1320058&group=) through Women's Society of Cyberjutsu. All are welcome but you will need to provide proof of registration from Offensive Security in order to participate.
