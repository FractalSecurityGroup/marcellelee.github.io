# Marcelle's Stuff

A note from Patrick: This page is meant to catalogue some of the resources Marcelle has created or discovered. We am not accepting submissions or suggestions for the foreseeable future, but this may change once we have everything sorted. I would like to thank kbroman for his excellent tutorial on setting up GitHub Pages, without which it would have taken me a lot longer to get this built.

If your material is shared here and you don't want it to be, please contact us. If I haven't credited you, please let us know immediately, and we will correct any such mistake as soon as possible.
