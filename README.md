# Marcelle's Mess

This repo is meant to catalogue the most valuable resources I have created or discovered. I am not accepting submissions or suggestions for the immediate future, but this may change once I have everything sorted.

If your material is shared here and you don't want it to be, please contact me. If I haven't credited you, please let me know immediately, and I will correct any such mistake as soon as possible.
