# Marcelle's Stuff

This page is meant to catalogue some of the resources I have created or discovered. I am not accepting submissions or suggestions for the foreseeable future, but this may change once I have everything sorted. I would like to thank kbroman for his excellent tutorial on setting up GitHub Pages, without which it would have taken me a lot longer to get this built.

If your material is shared here and you don't want it to be, please contact me. If I haven't credited you, please let me know immediately, and I will correct any such mistake as soon as possible.
