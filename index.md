> If you are in a male dominated workplace, don’t get too comfortable being the only woman in the room. Remember to try to find opportunities to bring other women in—to throw the rope down. It’s a dangerous thing to think: ‘I’m the woman in this room, so that’s my role.’ I try to tell young women—don’t be tricked into thinking that you’re in the field to compete with other women. ~ Tina Fey
