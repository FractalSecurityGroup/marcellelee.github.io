### Favorite Quotes

> The most dangerous phrase in the language is, ‘We’ve always done it this way.’ ~ Grace Hopper

> If you are in a male dominated workplace, don’t get too comfortable being the only woman in the room. Remember to try to find opportunities to bring other women in—to throw the rope down. It’s a dangerous thing to think: ‘I’m the woman in this room, so that’s my role.’ I try to tell young women—don’t be tricked into thinking that you’re in the field to compete with other women. ~ Tina Fey

> We live in a society exquisitely dependent on science and technology, in which hardly anyone knows anything about science and technology. ~ Carl Sagan

> You must be the change you wish to see in the world. ~ Mahatma Gandhi

> Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world; indeed, it's the only thing that ever has. ~ Margaret Mead
